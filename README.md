# Java Placement Training Programs

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of Java programs that I developed during my placement training. These programs cover a wide range of core computer science concepts and data structures frequently asked in technical interviews.

## Folder Structure

Each folder in this repository represents a specific topic or concept, and contains one or more Java programs related to that topic:

- **Array**: Programs for array manipulation, searching, and pattern-based problems.
- **Assignments**: Miscellaneous Java programs or exercises assigned during training.
- **Basics**: Basic Java syntax, input/output, conditional statements, loops, etc.
- **Linked List**: Implementation and operations on singly and doubly linked lists.
- **List**: Programs using Javaâ€™s List interface (e.g., ArrayList, LinkedList).
- **OOPs**: Object-Oriented Programming concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism.
- **Search Types**: Linear search, binary search, and variations.
- **Sorting**: Bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, quicksort, mergesort, etc.
- **Stack**: Stack implementation using arrays or linked lists; applications of stacks.
- **String**: String manipulation, palindrome check, pattern matching, etc.
- **mini_project (online Compiler)**: A mini-project for building an online compiler using Java.

## Purpose

This repository serves as:
- A personal revision resource
- A demonstration of problem-solving and programming skills in Java
- A portfolio for showcasing work done during placement preparation
